# project
The project  is an interface for a restaurant billing system, complete with discounts, tips and tax addition where necessary.
  • The interface will take inputs from the user as to what was bought from a predefined Menu. It will take in the quantity of each item entered and calculate the total amount of        the bill
  • Additionally, the interface will calculate taxes on the end sum and add it to the price.
  • Further the interface will calculate the tip to be given based on service rendered ( which the customer will rate) and also split the bill among the number of people (If           needed)
  • The program will also have an initial form, which includes personal details like phone number, name, birthday etc. 
The Interface will also be able to render discounts on the bill. For example , discounts will be given if the birthday of the customer is the current date, or if the total number of people is more than 7, etc.
